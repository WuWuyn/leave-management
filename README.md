## Leave Management System

This is a simple implementation of a Leave Management System, utilizing Java Servlets for its backend logic. Despite its simplicity, it incorporates several important features:

*   🔒 **OAuth Login:** Enables users to authenticate easily and securely via third-party OAuth providers.
*   🛡️ **2-Step Verification (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification upon login.
*   👥 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implements a permission system where access to features and data is determined by user roles (e.g., Employee, Manager, Administrator).

This project serves as a basic example of building a web application with these modern security and access control practices.
